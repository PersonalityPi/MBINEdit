# MBINEdit
A simple tool for viewing/editing No Man's Sky MBIN files. Currently only supports reading files using the GcDebugOptions template, but can be easily extended with other templates once they're mapped out.

Right now it only reads structures into a panel for viewing (see below), but editing support will be added soon.
