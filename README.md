# MBINEdit
A simple tool for viewing/editing No Man's Sky MBIN files. Currently only supports files using the GcDebugOptions template, but can be easily extended with other templates once they're mapped out.

Right now it can read structures into a panel for viewing (see below), and save the edited structure back to the MBIN file (although this hasn't been fully tested yet)
